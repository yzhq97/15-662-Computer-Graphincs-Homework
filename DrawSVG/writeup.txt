Extra credit:

    task 3 "specifying line width"
    I regarded a line segment as a long thin rectangle, and then factorize it into two triangles.
    This way the line widths are maintained when supersampled. The line width can be controlled by tweaking the variable "line_width" in "rasterize_line".

Any other comments and considerations:

    For task 3, I feel it would be very helpful if we covered "barycentric coordinates" earlier. A coordinate system inside the triangle makes the whole idea clear.

    For task 5, the README mentioned a few different spaces: screen space, SVG space / local space, SVG canvas coordinate space, normalized device coordinate space. It would be better if these terms are defined at the beginning.
    The parameter "vspan" is also a little confusing, I wondered why there isn't an "hspan", so it may be better to mention that aspect ratio is maintained in these view box transformations.

    For task 7, the changes after implementing trilinear filtering is subtle. Maybe a different test svg could make the effects more obvious, e.g., removing aliases.

    Thanks!
