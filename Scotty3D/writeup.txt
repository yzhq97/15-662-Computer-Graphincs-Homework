# flipEdge

Correctly implemented. Only problem is sometimes flipEdge will cause some surfaces to have 0 areas.
I have not implemented a checking mechanism to prevent this.

# splitEdge

Correctly implemented.

# edgeCollapse

Works when the two faces attached to the edge are not triangles. When it works,  I can correctly use next and twin to browse through half-edges.
I realized that the triangle case is equivalent to doing a faceCollapse on the triangle. If had more time, I would implement face collapse first.

# faceBevel

Correctly implemented.

# Modeling

Made a bird like creature.
